# Changelog

All notable changes to **SJF4J (Simple JSON Facade for Java)** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added `Nodes.removeIfInObject(...)` for safe in-place object-member removal during traversal against live object-key views.

### Fixed
- Fixed `Nodes.removeInObject(...)` to reject POJO structural field removal with the intended POJO-specific error path.

## [1.2.1] - 2026.04.27
### Added
- Added `Nodes.shape(...)` and `JsonContainer.shape()` to produce compact inspect-style structural summaries that keep supported container structure while rendering terminal values by simple runtime type name.
- Added Jackson 3 facade-node mutation support for object put/remove, array set/append/insert/remove, and JSONPath writes against Jackson 3 native tree nodes.
- Added `@NodeBinding(readDynamic = ... , writeDynamic = ...)` for JOJO types so unknown-field retention on read and dynamic-property emission on write can be controlled per type.
- Added instance-scoped `StreamingContext`, facade providers, and new `Sjf4j.Builder` hooks so each runtime can build isolated JSON/YAML/properties/node facades with its own streaming mode.
- Added `ValueFormatMapping`, named `ValueCodec` formats, `Sjf4j.Builder.defaultValueFormat(...)`, and `@NodeProperty(valueFormat = ...)` so value-codec selection can be configured per runtime, field, and creator parameter.
- Added `Sjf4j.Builder.includeNulls(...)` so each runtime can choose whether JSON serialization keeps or omits `null` properties across Gson, Jackson 2, Jackson 3, and Fastjson2 facades.

### Changed
- Changed Jackson 2 and Fastjson2 exclusive streaming IO paths to use backend-native typed read/write implementations for POJOs, containers, `AnyOf`, and value-codec flows while keeping shared `StreamingIO` semantics.
- Changed shared and backend-native POJO object writing paths to use dedicated `writePojo(...)` flows, keeping JOJO dynamic fields aligned across shared, Jackson 2, and Fastjson2 serializers.
- Changed snake-case conversion to live in `Strings.toSnakeCase(...)`, with `NamingStrategy.SNAKE_CASE` delegating to the shared helper.
- Changed `SchemaValidator` convention lookup to try `<simple-name>.json` first and then `<snake-name>.json`, instead of probing `<full-class-name>.json`.
- Changed node traversal helper naming from `visit*`/`anyMatchIn*` to `forEach*`/`anyMatch*` across shared node utilities and facade adapters.
- Changed JSONPath missing-container creation to recognize Jackson 3 native object/array node types.
- Changed `Nodes` and `JsonObject` object views to expose readable members only, while keeping direct write paths available for writable-only bindings.
- Changed shared and backend-native facade integrations to route through context-aware `StreamingIO`, with plugin-module fallbacks for SJF4J-managed value-codec and `AnyOf` cases.
- Changed Jackson 2 and Fastjson2 module reader/writer selection to resolve plain `JsonObject`/`JsonArray` separately from JOJO/POJO metadata-backed types, preserving owner type information for generic bindings.
- Changed path/schema traversal internals to use lighter `PathSegment` and `InstancedNode` metadata while standardizing rooted error-path reporting on JSONPath and JSON Pointer expressions.

### Fixed
- Fixed backend-native Jackson/Fastjson2 streaming and module paths to skip formatted value-codec resolution when a type has no registered codecs, reducing unnecessary metadata work and avoiding null-driven fallback drift.
- Fixed `JsonObject` writable traversal so dynamic entries honor `writeDynamic` during backend-native object serialization.
- Fixed `Types` generic substitution and resolution for parameterized types so raw-type preservation no longer depends on unsafe `Class` casts.
- Fixed `Nodes.to(...)` so `@NodeValue` and registered `ValueCodec` target types are converted through the shared node-facade binding path instead of failing as unsupported types.
- Fixed facade-node access metadata so Jackson 2, Jackson 3, and Gson object members report insertable child slots consistently, and array access reports appendable tail positions without forcing out-of-range reads.
- Fixed `JsonPath.ensurePut(...)` so single paths containing append segments (`/-` or `[+]`) can auto-create nested containers while appending new array elements.
- Fixed shared/simple/Jackson/Fastjson2 readable-member serialization and POJO projection paths so write-only bindings no longer leak into object traversal or output.
- Fixed field- and creator-bound non-default value formats so shared IO, exclusive IO, plugin-module reads/writes, node conversion, and `Sjf4j` runtime APIs all honor the same codec selection.
- Fixed deferred parent-scope `AnyOf` binding and runtime node conversion paths to use the owning `Sjf4j` instance instead of process-global facade defaults.


## [1.2.0] - 2026.04.12
### Breaking Changes
- `Sjf4j` is no longer a static facade. Migrate calls like `Sjf4j.fromJson(...)` to `Sjf4j.global().fromJson(...)` for process-wide defaults, or create an isolated instance with `new Sjf4j()` or `Sjf4j.builder().build()`.

### Added
- Added Jackson 3 facade integration with runtime auto-detection, global config entry points, Jackson3 `JsonNode` support, and JDK 17 coverage/JMH evaluation.
- Added container metadata and factory paths in `NodeRegistry` for concrete `Map`/`List`/`Set` target types.
- Added `@NodeBinding` with type-level `naming` and `access = AccessStrategy.BEAN_BASED/FIELD_BASED` so POJO binding semantics are cached per type instead of driven by mutable global defaults.

### Improved
- Improved `Nodes.to(...)`, `NodeFacade.readNode(...)`, and streaming IO binding so concrete `Map`/`List`/`Set` targets are created with their declared container implementations when supported.
- Improved `Nodes.copy(...)` and `deepNode(...)` to preserve concrete container types when possible and fall back to default mutable containers only on unsupported source implementations.
- Improved streaming `AnyOf` binding by caching container element/value `AnyOf` metadata on `FieldInfo` and avoiding redundant runtime `TypeInfo` lookups on hot read paths.
- Improved Gson facade integration by routing plugin-module reads and writes through shared `StreamingIO`, removing the separate Gson-exclusive streaming path, and aligning `hasAny` write performance with native Gson baselines.
- Improved plain-POJO fallback rules so default binding stays bean-oriented, `@NodeProperty` is the only field-level force-bind signal, and record component accessors continue to work under `BEAN_BASED`.
- Improved shared/Jackson/Gson/Fastjson2 streaming readers by separating raw node reads from typed dispatch, reducing duplicated `Object.class` hot-path work and closing the Fastjson2 JOJO gap against native any-setter baselines.
- Improved JSONPath/JSON Pointer handling so numeric pointer tokens preserve object-key semantics, filter strings unescape consistently, regex flags parse more strictly, and `&&` / `||` short-circuit during filter evaluation.

### Changed
- Changed `@AnyOf.Scope.SELF` to `CURRENT` for discriminator lookup naming.
- Changed `NodeRegistry` POJO routing flags from framework-centric reader/writer naming to `requiresPojoReader` / `requiresPojoWriter`, and removed `PojoInfo.newCreationSession()` in favor of direct `PojoCreationSession` construction.
- Changed POJO metadata analysis to read naming and field-access strategy only from `@NodeBinding`; `@NodeNaming` has been removed.
- Changed JSON Patch and RFC 7386 root-application APIs so `JsonPatch.apply(...)`, `PatchOperation.apply(...)`, `Patches.mergeRfc7386(...)`, and the `JsonContainer` wrappers return the possibly replaced root document.

### Removed
- Breaking: removed `Sjf4j.toPojo(...)` and `Sjf4j.mapperBuilder(...)` from the `Sjf4j` entry point; use `fromNode(...)` and `NodeMapperBuilder` directly instead.

### Fixed
- Fixed binding consistency for concrete container fields and root targets across shared and exclusive streaming backends.
- Fixed transient-field precedence so transient members are always ignored first, and transient fields annotated with `@NodeProperty` now fail fast during metadata analysis.
- Fixed backend contract drift in tests and plugin-module routing for plain POJOs, including Gson/Fastjson2 private-field behavior under `BEAN_BASED` and `FIELD_BASED`.
- Fixed Jackson/Jackson3 module installation so existing mapper annotation introspectors remain active alongside SJF4J `@NodeProperty` support.
- Fixed JSON Pointer parsing to reject invalid `~` escapes, preserve leading-zero numeric tokens, and route numeric pointer segments to object keys when the runtime container is object-shaped.
- Fixed `stddev()` to return standard deviation instead of variance, and reject terminal descendant paths like `$..` during compile time.
- Fixed JSON Patch / Merge Patch semantics for root replacement, `copy`/`move` of explicit `null`, deep-copy `copy`, atomic `move`, and numeric leaf equality during `diff`.
- Fixed JSON Schema compilation and validation edge cases so unknown keywords and formats are tolerated per draft 2020-12, local schemas without root `$id` retain their retrieval URI base for relative `$ref`, `null` subschemas fail fast, string length uses Unicode code points, and strict format checks cover core hostname / IPv6 / URI-template / relative JSON Pointer cases.
- Fixed JSON Schema resource URI bookkeeping by separating retrieval and canonical URIs during compile time, while keeping store registration keyed by canonical `$id`-resolved resource URIs.


## [1.1.6] - 2026.04.02
### Added
- Added `JsonPath.compileCached(String)` to provide an explicit cached compile path.
- Added `PathCache` interface with built-in `ConcurrentHashMap` as default implementation.
- Added `JsonPath.compute(...)` overloads to update every matched target from its current content.
- Added `NodeConverter`, `NodeMapper`, and `NodeMapperBuilder` for path-driven object graph mapping.
- Added `NamingStrategy` and `@NodeNaming` to map JSON property names like `snake_case` to Java fields without per-field annotations.

### Changed
- Changed `new JsonArray(...)`/`new JsonObject(...)` to `JsonArray.of(...)` and `JsonObject.of(...)` for simpler literal-style container creation.
- Changed `SchemaValidator` to validate `@ValidJsonSchema` along class inheritance chains (parent and child annotations both applied).

### Fixed
- Fixed inherited POJO field resolution when parent and child define the same key, ensuring child field metadata is preserved and parent metadata does not overwrite it.



## [1.1.5] - 2026.03.11
### Added
- Added `JSON-P` facade integration with runtime auto-detection in `FacadeFactory`.
- Added `AnyOf` resolution support in `StreamingFacade` and `NodeFacade`.
