# Changelog

All notable changes to **SJF4J (Simple JSON Facade for Java)** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Breaking Changes
- Removed `AccessStrategy` and the `@NodeBinding(access = ...)` contract in favor of property-family discovery through `@NodeBinding(propertyStrategy = PropertyStrategy...)`.
- Renamed POJO metadata APIs from field-oriented names to property-oriented names, including `NodeRegistry.FieldInfo` -> `PropertyInfo`, `fields`/`fieldCount` -> `properties`/`propertyCount`, and removal of `NodeRegistry.getFieldInfo(...)`.
- Renamed `@NodeProperty.valueFormat` to `@NodeProperty.codecName` for clarity.

### Added
- Added `PropertyStrategy` with `BEAN_ONLY`, `FIELD_ONLY`, `BEAN_FIELD`, and `FIELD_BEAN` modes for cached type-level POJO property discovery.
- Added `@NodeIgnore` so types, fields, getters, and setters can be excluded from SJF4J property discovery — class-level `@NodeIgnore` works like Jackson's `@JsonIgnoreType`, excluding all properties referencing the annotated type.
- Added `@NodeProperty.codecPattern` for DateTimeFormatter-based format patterns (e.g. `"yyyy-MM-dd"`), supported by `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, `OffsetDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime` value codecs.
- Added `PatternedValueCodec<V, R>` optional interface for value codecs that support format pattern parameterization.
- Added `ValueCodec` for `java.time.LocalTime` (supports `codecPattern`).
- Added `ValueCodec` for `java.util.Optional` — flattens `Optional.of(x)` → `x`, `Optional.empty()` → `null` (like Jackson).
- Added `ConcurrentHashMap` cache in `Types.resolveTypeArgument()` to memoize recursive generic type argument resolution results across repeated calls.

### Changed
- Changed POJO/JOJO binding to discover merged property families across fields, bean accessors, and record components, with bean-first `BEAN_FIELD` now the default strategy.
- Changed `@NodeProperty` to support bean methods in addition to fields and creator parameters, including method-level renames, aliases, and value-format metadata.
- Changed shared/backend streaming and node-conversion paths to use property-oriented metadata consistently across Jackson 2, Jackson 3, Fastjson2, Gson, and the simple facade.
- Changed `hasValueFormatBinding` / `hasPropertyValueFormatBinding` flags to check resolved value codecs instead of raw format strings, correctly reflecting both `codecName` and `codecPattern` bindings.
- Changed runtime binding/codec exception types from `JsonException` to `BindingException` in `NodeRegistry` (20 sites), `StreamingIO`, `Jackson2StreamingIO`, `Fastjson2StreamingIO`, `Fastjson2Reader`, `JsonpReader`, and `SnakeReader`.
- Changed 3 `RuntimeException` to `JsonException` in `ReflectUtil.analyzeNodeValue()`.
- Changed streaming read paths to thread `NodeRegistry.TypeInfo` (instead of raw `OneOfInfo`) through `_readNode → _readObject / _readArray → _readMap / _readList / _readSet / _readArray`, eliminating redundant `registerTypeInfo()` lookups on each recursive descent. Applied to `StreamingIO`, `Jackson2StreamingIO`, and `Fastjson2StreamingIO`.
- Renamed `ValueCodecInfo.getFormattedValueCodecInfo()` → `getValueCodecInfo()` and `formattedValueCodecs` → `namedValueCodecs` for clarity. Applied across all backend modules (Jackson 2, Jackson 3, Fastjson2, Gson, Simple) and the test suite.

### Removed
- Removed the old field-oriented `AccessStrategy` type and field-oriented POJO metadata naming from the public binding API.

### Fixed
- Fixed property binding consistency for renamed bean properties, field/bean family merging, `@OneOf`/value-format propagation, and creator-bound property conflict detection.
- Fixed property discovery fail-fast behavior for ambiguous getter/setter selection, duplicate aliases/final names, and transient fields annotated with `@NodeProperty`.
- Fixed `ReflectionBenchmark` and `SchemaBenchmark` JMH benchmarks to use current APIs (`pi.properties.get("name")` instead of removed `NodeRegistry.getPropertyInfo()`, `createPlan()` instead of removed `plan()`).


## [1.2.3] - 2026.05.11
### Breaking Changes
- Schema validation now runs through compiled `SchemaPlan` instances instead of the old in-place schema compile/validate flow. `JsonSchema.createPlan(...)` is the primary entry point, schema registries separate indexed resources from compiled plans, and post-compile mutable schema runtime state assumptions no longer hold.
- Polymorphic binding annotation naming now uses `@OneOf` in place of `@AnyOf`; the old `@AnyOf` API has been removed with no compatibility alias.
- Patch merge APIs now distinguish RFC 7386 `mergePatch(...)` from SJF4J `indexedMerge(...)`; old `JsonContainer.merge(...)`, `mergeWithCopy(...)`, single-argument `indexedMerge(...)` / `indexedMergeWithCopy(...)`, and the instance `JsonContainer.mergePatch(...)` wrapper have been removed.

### Added
- Added `FacadeNodes.removeIfInObject(...)` with Jackson 2, Jackson 3, and Gson backend support so native facade object nodes can remove matching properties in place.
- Added scalar/container-specific `Nodes.WalkTarget` modes so traversal visitors can target objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, and unknown values without post-filtering.

### Changed
- Refactored the schema module around compiled `SchemaPlan` instances so schema resources, compiled plans, and runtime validation state are separated cleanly; retrieval/canonical URI handling, deferred remote indexing, `$ref` / `$dynamicRef` resolution, dialect vocabulary activation, and error diagnostics are now consistent across local resources, remotes, refs, and validator-based loading.
- Changed JSON object conversion to separate explicit map wrapping from object-view projection: `Nodes.toJsonObject(...)` now returns existing `JsonObject` instances as-is, wraps `Map` inputs, and materializes other object-like sources through `putAll(Object)`.
- Changed patch merge naming and semantics to distinguish RFC 7386 `mergePatch(...)` from SJF4J `indexedMerge(...)`; indexed array merge now supports sparse index updates with skip-on-null entries and trailing-null tail truncation such as `[null] -> []` and `[1, 2, null] -> [1, 2]`.
- Changed polymorphic binding annotation naming from `@AnyOf` to `@OneOf`, including nested mapping/scope types, diagnostics, and core binding metadata/helper names; the old `@AnyOf` API has been removed with no compatibility alias.
- Changed JSONPath / JSON Pointer factory naming from `compile(...)` to `parse(...)` across the public path APIs and path-based convenience helpers so the entry point matches the operation these methods perform.
- Changed the path function registry type name from `PathFunctionRegistry` to `FunctionRegistry` to keep the path API surface shorter after the surrounding path helpers were renamed.

### Removed
- Removed `JsonContainer` convenience overloads for the old merge naming, including `merge(...)`, `mergeWithCopy(...)`, and the single-argument `indexedMerge(...)` / `indexedMergeWithCopy(...)` variants, and removed the instance `JsonContainer.mergePatch(...)` wrapper in favor of explicit `indexedMerge(patch, overwrite, deepCopy)` and static `Patches.mergePatch(target, patch)` entry points.
- Removed the old path/schema helper type names `Paths`, `PathFunctionRegistry`, and `SchemaCompilers` with no compatibility aliases; use `PathSyntax`, `FunctionRegistry`, and `SchemaPlanner` instead.
- Removed the old in-place schema compile/validate flow in favor of explicit `SchemaPlan` creation and execution, including the former schema/store naming path and mutable post-compile schema state assumptions.
- Removed the mixed-semantics `JsonObject(Object)` constructor plus the `putAll(Map)` / `putAll(JsonObject)` overloads in favor of `new JsonObject(map)` and `putAll(Object)`, and renamed JOJO dynamic-map accessors from `getDynamicMap()` / `setDynamicMap(...)` to `_dynamicMap()` / `_dynamicMap(...)`.
- Removed `Strings.requireNonEmpty(...)`, both `Strings.truncateMiddle(...)` helpers, and the placeholder `LoggerUtil` type.

### Fixed
- Fixed `Nodes.removeIfInObject(...)` to stay property-only: structural POJO fields are preserved, while removable JOJO dynamic entries and facade-backed object properties can still be deleted safely.
- Fixed schema compilation/validation consistency across official remotes and annotation-driven loading, including deferred remote indexing, root relative `$id` handling, classpath/resource lookup, anchor and pointer refs, official `dynamicRef` coverage, and draft 2020-12 `format-assertion` metaschema behavior.


## [1.2.2] - 2026.04.30
### Added
- Added `Nodes.removeIfInObject(...)` for safe in-place object-member removal during traversal against live object-key views.
- Added `Sjf4j.bindNode(...)` plus `JsonContainer.bindNode(...)` so callers can opt into alias-preserving node binding without the deep-copy isolation of `fromNode(...)` / `toNode(...)`.

### Changed
- Changed schema registry naming to use `SchemaRegistry` consistently across schema compilation, export, loading, and validator APIs.
- Changed schema validation diagnostics to report both instance and keyword JSON Pointer paths, and deprecated `ValidationMessage.getPs()` in favor of structured `getInstancePath()` / `getKeywordPath()` accessors.

### Removed
- Removed the old `SchemaStore` type and its legacy `toStore()` / `compile(SchemaStore)` naming in favor of `SchemaRegistry` and `toRegistry()`.

### Fixed
- Fixed `ObjectSchema` post-compile mutation paths to become read-only, preventing schema tree edits from drifting away from compiled evaluator and reference-resolution state.
- Fixed `Nodes.removeInObject(...)` to reject POJO structural field removal with the intended POJO-specific error path.
- Fixed fail-fast schema validation diagnostics so nested failures like `additionalProperties: false`, nested `type`, and `propertyNames` errors retain the offending instance member path alongside the triggering schema keyword path.

## [1.2.1] - 2026.04.27
### Added
- Added `Nodes.shape(...)` and `JsonContainer.shape()` to produce compact inspect-style structural summaries that keep supported container structure while rendering terminal values by simple runtime type name.
- Added Jackson 3 facade-node mutation support for object put/remove, array set/append/insert/remove, and JSONPath writes against Jackson 3 native tree nodes.
- Added `@NodeBinding(readDynamic = ... , writeDynamic = ...)` for JOJO types so unknown-field retention on read and dynamic-property emission on write can be controlled per type.
- Added instance-scoped `StreamingContext`, facade providers, and new `Sjf4j.Builder` hooks so each runtime can build isolated JSON/YAML/properties/node facades with its own streaming mode.
- Added `ValueFormatMapping`, named `ValueCodec` formats, `Sjf4j.Builder.defaultValueFormat(...)`, and `@NodeProperty(valueFormat = ...)` so value-codec selection can be configured per runtime, field, and creator parameter.
- Added `Sjf4j.Builder.includeNulls(...)` so each runtime can choose whether JSON serialization keeps or omits `null` properties across Gson, Jackson 2, Jackson 3, and Fastjson2 facades.

### Changed
- Changed Jackson 2 and Fastjson2 exclusive streaming IO paths to use backend-native typed read/write implementations for POJOs, containers, `AnyOf`, and value-codec flows while keeping shared `StreamingIO` semantics.
- Changed shared and backend-native POJO object writing paths to use dedicated `writePojo(...)` flows, keeping JOJO dynamic fields aligned across shared, Jackson 2, and Fastjson2 serializers.
- Changed snake-case conversion to live in `Strings.toSnakeCase(...)`, with `NamingStrategy.SNAKE_CASE` delegating to the shared helper.
- Changed `SchemaValidator` convention lookup to try `<simple-name>.json` first and then `<snake-name>.json`, instead of probing `<full-class-name>.json`.
- Changed node traversal helper naming from `visit*`/`anyMatchIn*` to `forEach*`/`anyMatch*` across shared node utilities and facade adapters.
- Changed JSONPath missing-container creation to recognize Jackson 3 native object/array node types.
- Changed `Nodes` and `JsonObject` object views to expose readable members only, while keeping direct write paths available for writable-only bindings.
- Changed shared and backend-native facade integrations to route through context-aware `StreamingIO`, with plugin-module fallbacks for SJF4J-managed value-codec and `AnyOf` cases.
- Changed Jackson 2 and Fastjson2 module reader/writer selection to resolve plain `JsonObject`/`JsonArray` separately from JOJO/POJO metadata-backed types, preserving owner type information for generic bindings.
- Changed path/schema traversal internals to use lighter `PathSegment` and `InstancedNode` metadata while standardizing rooted error-path reporting on JSONPath and JSON Pointer expressions.

### Fixed
- Fixed backend-native Jackson/Fastjson2 streaming and module paths to skip formatted value-codec resolution when a type has no registered codecs, reducing unnecessary metadata work and avoiding null-driven fallback drift.
- Fixed `JsonObject` writable traversal so dynamic entries honor `writeDynamic` during backend-native object serialization.
- Fixed `Types` generic substitution and resolution for parameterized types so raw-type preservation no longer depends on unsafe `Class` casts.
- Fixed `Nodes.to(...)` so `@NodeValue` and registered `ValueCodec` target types are converted through the shared node-facade binding path instead of failing as unsupported types.
- Fixed facade-node access metadata so Jackson 2, Jackson 3, and Gson object members report insertable child slots consistently, and array access reports appendable tail positions without forcing out-of-range reads.
- Fixed `JsonPath.ensurePut(...)` so single paths containing append segments (`/-` or `[+]`) can auto-create nested containers while appending new array elements.
- Fixed shared/simple/Jackson/Fastjson2 readable-member serialization and POJO projection paths so write-only bindings no longer leak into object traversal or output.
- Fixed field- and creator-bound non-default value formats so shared IO, exclusive IO, plugin-module reads/writes, node conversion, and `Sjf4j` runtime APIs all honor the same codec selection.
- Fixed deferred parent-scope `AnyOf` binding and runtime node conversion paths to use the owning `Sjf4j` instance instead of process-global facade defaults.


## [1.2.0] - 2026.04.12
### Breaking Changes
- `Sjf4j` is no longer a static facade. Migrate calls like `Sjf4j.fromJson(...)` to `Sjf4j.global().fromJson(...)` for process-wide defaults, or create an isolated instance with `new Sjf4j()` or `Sjf4j.builder().build()`.

### Added
- Added Jackson 3 facade integration with runtime auto-detection, global config entry points, Jackson3 `JsonNode` support, and JDK 17 coverage/JMH evaluation.
- Added container metadata and factory paths in `NodeRegistry` for concrete `Map`/`List`/`Set` target types.
- Added `@NodeBinding` with type-level `naming` and `access = AccessStrategy.BEAN_BASED/FIELD_BASED` so POJO binding semantics are cached per type instead of driven by mutable global defaults.

### Improved
- Improved `Nodes.to(...)`, `NodeFacade.readNode(...)`, and streaming IO binding so concrete `Map`/`List`/`Set` targets are created with their declared container implementations when supported.
- Improved `Nodes.copy(...)` and `deepNode(...)` to preserve concrete container types when possible and fall back to default mutable containers only on unsupported source implementations.
- Improved streaming `AnyOf` binding by caching container element/value `AnyOf` metadata on `FieldInfo` and avoiding redundant runtime `TypeInfo` lookups on hot read paths.
- Improved Gson facade integration by routing plugin-module reads and writes through shared `StreamingIO`, removing the separate Gson-exclusive streaming path, and aligning `hasAny` write performance with native Gson baselines.
- Improved plain-POJO fallback rules so default binding stays bean-oriented, `@NodeProperty` is the only field-level force-bind signal, and record component accessors continue to work under `BEAN_BASED`.
- Improved shared/Jackson/Gson/Fastjson2 streaming readers by separating raw node reads from typed dispatch, reducing duplicated `Object.class` hot-path work and closing the Fastjson2 JOJO gap against native any-setter baselines.
- Improved JSONPath/JSON Pointer handling so numeric pointer tokens preserve object-key semantics, filter strings unescape consistently, regex flags parse more strictly, and `&&` / `||` short-circuit during filter evaluation.

### Changed
- Changed `@AnyOf.Scope.SELF` to `CURRENT` for discriminator lookup naming.
- Changed `NodeRegistry` POJO routing flags from framework-centric reader/writer naming to `requiresPojoReader` / `requiresPojoWriter`, and removed `PojoInfo.newCreationSession()` in favor of direct `PojoCreationSession` construction.
- Changed POJO metadata analysis to read naming and field-access strategy only from `@NodeBinding`; `@NodeNaming` has been removed.
- Changed JSON Patch and RFC 7386 root-application APIs so `JsonPatch.apply(...)`, `PatchOperation.apply(...)`, `Patches.mergeRfc7386(...)`, and the `JsonContainer` wrappers return the possibly replaced root document.

### Removed
- Breaking: removed `Sjf4j.toPojo(...)` and `Sjf4j.mapperBuilder(...)` from the `Sjf4j` entry point; use `fromNode(...)` and `NodeMapperBuilder` directly instead.

### Fixed
- Fixed binding consistency for concrete container fields and root targets across shared and exclusive streaming backends.
- Fixed transient-field precedence so transient members are always ignored first, and transient fields annotated with `@NodeProperty` now fail fast during metadata analysis.
- Fixed backend contract drift in tests and plugin-module routing for plain POJOs, including Gson/Fastjson2 private-field behavior under `BEAN_BASED` and `FIELD_BASED`.
- Fixed Jackson/Jackson3 module installation so existing mapper annotation introspectors remain active alongside SJF4J `@NodeProperty` support.
- Fixed JSON Pointer parsing to reject invalid `~` escapes, preserve leading-zero numeric tokens, and route numeric pointer segments to object keys when the runtime container is object-shaped.
- Fixed `stddev()` to return standard deviation instead of variance, and reject terminal descendant paths like `$..` during compile time.
- Fixed JSON Patch / Merge Patch semantics for root replacement, `copy`/`move` of explicit `null`, deep-copy `copy`, atomic `move`, and numeric leaf equality during `diff`.
- Fixed JSON Schema compilation and validation edge cases so unknown keywords and formats are tolerated per draft 2020-12, local schemas without root `$id` retain their retrieval URI base for relative `$ref`, `null` subschemas fail fast, string length uses Unicode code points, and strict format checks cover core hostname / IPv6 / URI-template / relative JSON Pointer cases.
- Fixed JSON Schema resource URI bookkeeping by separating retrieval and canonical URIs during compile time, while keeping store registration keyed by canonical `$id`-resolved resource URIs.


## [1.1.6] - 2026.04.02
### Added
- Added `JsonPath.compute(...)` overloads to update every matched target from its current content.
- Added `NodeConverter`, `NodeMapper`, and `NodeMapperBuilder` for path-driven object graph mapping.
- Added `NamingStrategy` and `@NodeNaming` to map JSON property names like `snake_case` to Java fields without per-field annotations.

### Improved
- Improved node conversion extensibility so exact source/target converters can participate in nested POJO and collection binding flows.

### Changed
- Changed `new JsonArray(...)`/`new JsonObject(...)` to `JsonArray.of(...)` and `JsonObject.of(...)` for simpler literal-style container creation.
- Changed `SchemaValidator` to validate `@ValidJsonSchema` along class inheritance chains (parent and child annotations both applied).

### Fixed
- Fixed inherited POJO field resolution when parent and child define the same key, ensuring child field metadata is preserved and parent metadata does not overwrite it.



## [1.1.5] - 2026.03.11
### Added
- Added `JSON-P` facade integration with runtime auto-detection in `FacadeFactory`.
- Added `AnyOf` resolution support in `StreamingFacade` and `NodeFacade`.

  recognized and handled seamlessly, with their canonical constructors used for instantiation without requiring 
  explicit `@NodeCreator` annotations.
- Improved constructor parameter name resolution for `@NodeCreator` annotated constructors, supporting both 
  `@NodeProperty` explicit naming and automatic parameter name detection (when compiled with `-parameters` flag).
